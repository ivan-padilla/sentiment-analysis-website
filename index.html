        <h1>DU30's ICC Arrest: A Sentiment Analysis on FB Comments Using Machine Learning</h1>
        <p>
            On March 11, 2025, former Philippine President Rodrigo 'Digong' Roa Duterte was arrested in Manila
            by the Philippine National Police (PNP) and Interpol with a warrant from the International Criminal Court (ICC) 
            charging him with crimes against humanity. He was initially held at the Villamor Air Base and then flown to the 
            Netherlands to face trial in The Hague. His arrest was in relation to the extrajudicial killings during his time 
            as mayor in Davao and his bloody war on drugs during his presidency. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This news garnered a lot of attention from supporters and critics and soon enough, social media platforms such as 
            Facebook were flooded with comments ranging from condemnation and support of the arrest.
        </p>
        <p>
            Analyzing these comments manually would be difficult. However, machine learning can make the process faster, 
            more efficient, and cheaper. Sentiment analysis, in particular, is the process of extracting subjective information 
            from texts, like whether a comment is positive or negative.
        </p>
        <p>
            This leads us to an important question:<b> Do more people react positively to the former president's arrest? </b>
        </p>
        <h2>Dataset Collection</h2>
        <p>
            To train the machine learning model, 500 comments were scraped on Facebook using Apify, a cloud platform for 
            web scraping and browser automation. Two AI agents—systems that use large language models (LLMs) to do certain 
            tasks—were utilized, specifically the Facebook Scraper Pro by alien_force and Facebook Post Comments Scraper 
            by easyapi. 
        </p>
        <p>
            These AI agents scraped comments only from following Facebook posts of major news sites in the Philippines:

        <h2>Dataset Preprocessing</h2>
        <p>
            After collection, the dataset underwent preprocessing. All scraped comments were combined into a single dataset, 
            and using a python script, each comment was translated to English using the Deep Translator library and 
            Google Translate . Since the translation process is not perfect, the dataset was manually inspected, and all the 
            translation errors were corrected. Finally, all comments were labeled 1 (positive) or 2 (negative).

        <h2>Model Training</h2>
        <p>
            The dataset was split into 70% training and 30% testing ratio. When training the machine learning model, 
            the Pipeline class by scikit-learn was utilized, as it streamlines data preprocessing and model training into a 
            single process. The pipeline contains Count Vectorizer, Term-Frequency Times Inverse Document-Frequency (TF-IDF) 
            Transformer, and, lastly, Support Vector Classifier.
        </p>

        </div>

        <p>
            Count Vectorizer converts a collection of text documents to a matrix of token counts, while TF-IDF Transformer 
            transforms a count of matrix to a normalized TF or TF-IDF representation. Count Vectorizer uses a custom tokenizer 
            that performs lemmatization, a process of reducing words to their base form.
        </p>
        <p>
            To streamline the model optimization, a parameter grid search was used. GridSearchCV from scikit-learn performs 
            an exhaustive search over specified parameter values for an estimator—in this case, the pipeline.
        </p>
        <p>
            Running the grid search resulted to the following parameters:

            After training the model using the best parameters produced in the grid search, 
            the model was then used to evaluate the test dataset. The model achieved the following results:

        <p>
            Given these metrics, accuracy is the best fit for evaluating the model, as the dataset is generally balanced. 
            The model is able to identify whether a comment is positive or negative with 86% accuracy. 
            Notably, the baseline for sentiment evaluation is 80-85% (humans tend to agree within this range), 
            and industry standards fall between 70% and 90%. With an accuracy of 86%, 
            the model is already considered a good one.
        </p>
        <h2>Sentiment Analysis</h2>
        <p>
            Since the goal is to analyze Facebook comments about the former President's arrest, another 500 
            comments were scraped (unseen by the model). All comments also underwent preprocessing, from 
            cleaning to translation. The model was then used to predict the sentiment of the translated comments. 
            It predicted that 269 comments were negative, while 231 were positive.
        </p>
        <div class="graph">
            <iframe src="assets/categoryFig.html"></iframe>                   
        </div>
        <p>
            The following graph shows the breakdown of sentiments by gender. Among the negative comments, 
            138 were from females and 131 from males. Conversely, 118 positive comments were from females, 
            while 113 were from males.
        </p>
        <div class="graph">
            <iframe src="assets/categoryGenderFig.html"></iframe>                   
        </div>
        <p>
            Analyzing the length of comments—based on the number of characters, 
            including spaces and special characters—negative comments average 133 characters, 
            with a maximum of nearly 5,000 characters. Positive comments average 147 characters, 
            slightly higher than negative comments, with a maximum of 1,000 characters.
        </p>
        <div class="graph">
            <iframe src="assets/commentLength.html"></iframe>                   
        </div>
        <p>
            For further analysis, topic modeling was conducted on the translated comments. 
            Topic modeling is a technique in natural language processing (NLP) that extracts 
            themes or topics from a collection of documents—in this case, Facebook comments.
        </p>
        <p>
            Several unsupervised learning techniques are used for topic modeling, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) 
            and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). LDA is a probabilistic form of topic modeling that assumes 
            documents are mixtures of topics, while NMF decomposes a document-term matrix into topic and term weight matrices.
        </p>
        <p>
            Using these two techniques, the top ten words for the ten topics were extracted.

        <h2>Hypothesis Testing</h2>
        <p>
            Circling back to the question, <b>"Do more people react positively to the former President's arrest?"</b>, 
            a null and an alternative hypothesis were proposed.
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Null Hypothesis: </b> There is no significant difference between positive and negative comments. </li>
                <li><b>Alternative Hypothesis: </b> There is a significant difference between positive and negative comments. </li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            To test these hypotheses, a chi-square test was performed using SciPy's statistics module.
            <br>
            The calculated chi-square statistic is <b>2.89</b>, the P-value is <b>0.9</b>, and the critical value is <b>3.8</b>. 
            Since the P-value is greater than the alpha level of <b>0.05</b>, and the chi-square statistic is 
            less than the critical value, <b>we must accept the null hypothesis.</b>
        </p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The model achieved <b>86% accuracy</b></li>
            <li><b>269</b> of the comments are <b>negative</b> while <b>231</b> comments are <b>positive.</b> </li>
            <li><b>Negative comments</b> are from <b>138 females</b> and <b>131 males.</b></li>
            <li><b>Positive comments</b> are from <b>118 females</b> and <b>113 males.</b></li>
            <li><b>Positive comments</b> on average, are <b>longer by 14 characters</b> than negative comments</li>
            <li>The top words mainly revolve around <b>justice, politics, law enforcement, and media coverage</b>. 
                There's a strong focus on <b>arrests, courts, accountability,</b> and leaders like 
                <b>Duterte</b> and <b>Marcos.</b> Some words show <b>support</b> or <b>disagreement</b> with events, 
                while others express <b>hope, love,</b> or <b>faith.</b></li>
            <li>There is <b>no significant difference</b> between positive and negative comments.</li>
        </ul>
